# Feature Specification: Authentication and API Security

**Feature Branch**: `002-auth-api-security`
**Created**: 2026-01-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Todo App – Spec 2: Authentication and API Security - Secure user authentication using Better Auth, JWT-based identity verification between frontend and backend, enforcing strict user isolation across all API operations, demonstrating stateless authentication in a multi-service architecture"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - New User Registration (Priority: P1)

A new user visits the application and wants to create an account to start managing their personal tasks. They provide their email address, choose a password, and submit the registration form. The system validates their input, creates their account, and issues a JWT token that allows them to immediately start using the application.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the entire authentication system. Without user registration, no users can access the application. This is the entry point for all user interactions and must work correctly for the feature to have any value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a registration form with valid credentials and verifying that a user account is created in the database and a valid JWT token is returned. Delivers immediate value by allowing the first user to join the system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the registration page, **When** they enter a valid email (user@example.com) and password (meeting requirements), **Then** their account is created, they receive a JWT token, and they are redirected to the main application
2. **Given** a user attempts to register, **When** they enter an email that already exists in the system, **Then** they receive a clear error message stating "Email already registered" and are not issued a token
3. **Given** a user attempts to register, **When** they enter a password that doesn't meet requirements (less than 8 characters), **Then** they receive a validation error and the account is not created
4. **Given** a user attempts to register, **When** they enter an invalid email format (missing @), **Then** they receive a validation error before submission

---

### User Story 2 - Returning User Sign In (Priority: P2)

An existing user returns to the application and wants to access their tasks. They enter their email and password on the sign-in page. The system verifies their credentials against the stored user data and issues a fresh JWT token that grants them access to their personal task list.

**Why this priority**: This is the second most critical flow. Once users can register (P1), they need to be able to return and access their data. Without sign-in, users would only be able to use the app once, making it effectively useless.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a user account, signing out, then signing back in with the same credentials and verifying that a valid JWT token is issued. Delivers value by enabling repeat usage of the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered user is on the sign-in page, **When** they enter their correct email and password, **Then** they receive a valid JWT token and are redirected to their task dashboard
2. **Given** a registered user attempts to sign in, **When** they enter an incorrect password, **Then** they receive an error message "Invalid credentials" and are not issued a token
3. **Given** a user attempts to sign in, **When** they enter an email that doesn't exist in the system, **Then** they receive an error message "Invalid credentials" (same as wrong password for security)
4. **Given** a user successfully signs in, **When** they receive their JWT token, **Then** the token contains their user ID and email in the payload

---

### User Story 3 - Accessing Protected Resources (Priority: P3)

An authenticated user with a valid JWT token makes requests to the backend API to view, create, update, or delete their tasks. Each API request includes the JWT token in the Authorization header. The backend verifies the token signature, extracts the user identity, and ensures the user can only access their own data.

**Why this priority**: This demonstrates the core security mechanism working end-to-end. It proves that the JWT authentication protects resources and enforces user isolation. This is what evaluators will scrutinize most carefully.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by signing in as User A, making API requests with their token, and verifying they only see their own tasks. Then sign in as User B and verify they see completely different data. Delivers value by proving the security model works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a valid JWT token, **When** they make a GET request to /api/todos with the token in the Authorization header, **Then** they receive only their own tasks (filtered by their user ID from the token)
2. **Given** a user has a valid JWT token, **When** they make a POST request to /api/todos to create a new task, **Then** the task is created and automatically associated with their user ID (extracted from the token)
3. **Given** User A has a valid JWT token, **When** they attempt to access a task that belongs to User B (by guessing the task ID), **Then** they receive a 403 Forbidden error
4. **Given** a user has a valid JWT token, **When** they make a DELETE request to /api/todos/{id} for their own task, **Then** the task is deleted successfully

---

### User Story 4 - Handling Unauthorized Access (Priority: P4)

A user attempts to access protected API endpoints without a valid JWT token, or with an expired/invalid token. The backend detects the missing or invalid authentication and returns a 401 Unauthorized response with a clear error message, preventing any access to protected resources.

**Why this priority**: This is the security boundary enforcement. While less critical than the happy paths (P1-P3), it's essential for demonstrating that the security model actually prevents unauthorized access. This is what makes the authentication meaningful.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making API requests without a token, with a malformed token, or with an expired token, and verifying that all return 401 errors. Delivers value by proving the system is secure against unauthorized access attempts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user makes an API request to /api/todos, **When** they do not include an Authorization header, **Then** they receive a 401 Unauthorized response with message "Authentication required"
2. **Given** a user makes an API request to /api/todos, **When** they include a malformed JWT token (invalid signature), **Then** they receive a 401 Unauthorized response with message "Invalid token"
3. **Given** a user makes an API request to /api/todos, **When** they include an expired JWT token, **Then** they receive a 401 Unauthorized response with message "Token expired"
4. **Given** a user makes an API request to /api/todos, **When** they include a token signed with the wrong secret key, **Then** they receive a 401 Unauthorized response with message "Invalid token signature"

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's JWT token expires while they're actively using the application? (User should receive 401 and be prompted to sign in again)
- How does the system handle concurrent sign-ins from the same user on different devices? (Each device gets its own JWT token; all tokens are valid until expiration)
- What happens if the JWT secret key is changed/rotated? (All existing tokens become invalid; users must sign in again)
- How does the system handle malformed Authorization headers (missing "Bearer" prefix)? (Return 401 with clear error message)
- What happens when a user attempts to register with an email containing special characters or Unicode? (Email validation should handle standard email formats including special chars)
- How does the system handle very long passwords (e.g., 1000+ characters)? (Set reasonable maximum length, e.g., 128 characters)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents a registered user account with email (unique identifier), password hash, creation timestamp, and optional profile information (name). Each user owns a collection of tasks and can only access their own data.
- **JWT Token**: Represents an authentication credential issued to users upon successful registration or sign-in. Contains payload with user ID, email, issuance time, and expiration time. Signed with secret key to prevent tampering. Not stored in database (stateless).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete account registration in under 30 seconds with valid credentials
- **SC-002**: Users can sign in and receive a valid JWT token in under 2 seconds
- **SC-003**: 100% of API requests without valid JWT tokens are rejected with 401 status code
- **SC-004**: 100% of API requests with valid JWT tokens successfully authenticate and return user-specific data
- **SC-005**: Users can only view and modify their own tasks; cross-user data access attempts result in 403 errors
- **SC-006**: System correctly handles 1000 concurrent authentication requests without token verification failures
- **SC-007**: JWT token verification adds less than 50ms latency to API request processing
- **SC-008**: Zero instances of users accessing another user's data in security testing
- **SC-009**: Authentication flow works correctly across different browsers and devices
- **SC-010**: Evaluators can verify JWT token structure and signature using standard JWT debugging tools

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Better Auth library is compatible with Next.js 16+ App Router and can be configured for JWT token issuance
- FastAPI backend can verify JWT tokens using standard Python JWT libraries (PyJWT or python-jose)
- Frontend and backend share the same JWT secret key via environment variables
- Neon PostgreSQL database is already set up and accessible (from Feature 001)
- Users table schema can be extended or created to store authentication credentials
- HTTPS is used in production to protect JWT tokens in transit (not implemented in this feature, but assumed for deployment)
- Token refresh mechanism is not required for hackathon MVP (users re-authenticate after 1 hour)
- Email verification is not required for account activation (users can sign in immediately after registration)
- Password reset functionality is deferred to future features
- Frontend has a mechanism to store JWT tokens (localStorage or sessionStorage)

## Constraints *(mandatory)*

- **Technology Lock-in**: Must use Better Auth library for frontend authentication; cannot substitute with other auth libraries
- **Authentication Method**: JWT tokens are the only supported authentication mechanism; no session-based auth or cookies
- **Stateless Requirement**: Backend must not store JWT tokens or session state in database; all authentication state must be in the token itself
- **Secret Management**: JWT secret key must be stored in environment variables (.env files); never hardcoded in source code
- **Endpoint Protection**: Every API endpoint (except signup/signin) must enforce JWT authentication; no unprotected endpoints allowed
- **Development Process**: All code must be generated via Claude Code using spec-driven development; no manual coding permitted
- **Timeline**: Must be completed within Hackathon Phase-2 timeframe
- **Scope Boundary**: No OAuth providers, refresh tokens, RBAC, password reset, or rate limiting in this feature

## Out of Scope *(mandatory)*

- OAuth 2.0 integration with third-party providers (Google, GitHub, Facebook)
- Refresh token generation and rotation strategies
- Role-based access control (RBAC) or permission systems
- Account recovery flows (forgot password, email verification)
- Password reset functionality
- Rate limiting or brute-force protection
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA)
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Email verification on registration
- User profile management (update email, change password)
- Token revocation or blacklisting mechanisms
- Advanced security features (CAPTCHA, device fingerprinting)
- Audit logging of authentication events
- Social login integration

## Dependencies *(mandatory)*

- **Feature 001 (Todo Web App)**: Requires the basic application structure, database connection, and user table schema to be in place
- **Better Auth Library**: Frontend authentication depends on Better Auth SDK being installed and configured
- **JWT Library (Backend)**: FastAPI backend requires PyJWT or python-jose library for token verification
- **Environment Variables**: Both frontend and backend must have access to shared JWT secret key via .env files
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Database must be accessible and have users table with email and password_hash columns
- **CORS Configuration**: Backend must allow cross-origin requests from frontend domain

## Risks *(mandatory)*

- **Risk 1 - JWT Secret Exposure**: If the JWT secret key is accidentally committed to version control or exposed in logs, all tokens can be forged
  - **Mitigation**: Use .gitignore to exclude .env files; implement secret scanning in CI/CD; use different secrets for dev/prod

- **Risk 2 - Better Auth Configuration Complexity**: Better Auth may require complex configuration to issue JWT tokens instead of session cookies
  - **Mitigation**: Review Better Auth documentation thoroughly; allocate time for configuration troubleshooting; have fallback plan to use standard JWT library if Better Auth proves incompatible

- **Risk 3 - Token Expiration UX**: Users will be abruptly logged out after 1 hour with no warning or auto-refresh
  - **Mitigation**: Accept this limitation for hackathon MVP; document as known issue; plan token refresh for future iteration

## Target Audience *(optional)*

- **Primary**: Hackathon evaluators assessing security implementation correctness and cross-stack authentication patterns
- **Secondary**: Developers learning how to implement JWT-based authentication between Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend
- **Tertiary**: Technical teams evaluating stateless authentication architectures for multi-service applications

## Non-Functional Requirements *(optional)*

- **Security**: All passwords must be hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12) or argon2; JWT tokens must use HS256 algorithm; error messages must not reveal whether email exists in system
- **Performance**: JWT token verification must complete in under 50ms; authentication endpoints must respond in under 2 seconds under normal load
- **Reliability**: Authentication system must maintain 99.9% uptime during hackathon evaluation period; token verification must never produce false positives or false negatives
- **Usability**: Error messages must be clear and actionable; registration and sign-in forms must provide immediate validation feedback
- **Compatibility**: Must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers; must support mobile and desktop viewports
