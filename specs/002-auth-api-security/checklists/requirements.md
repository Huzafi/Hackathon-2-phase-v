# Specification Quality Checklist: Authentication and API Security

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Review Notes**:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification is written in business language focusing on user authentication flows and security requirements. While it mentions specific technologies (Better Auth, JWT, FastAPI, Next.js), these are constraints provided by the user and documented in the Constraints section, not implementation details leaked into requirements.

2. **Requirements Completeness**: All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "under 30 seconds", "100% of API requests", "less than 50ms latency").

3. **Success Criteria Quality**: All 10 success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable:
   - SC-001 through SC-010 focus on user-facing outcomes (completion time, success rates, security guarantees)
   - No implementation-specific metrics (e.g., "database query time" or "React render performance")
   - All criteria can be verified through testing without knowing implementation details

4. **User Scenarios**: Four prioritized user stories (P1-P4) cover the complete authentication lifecycle:
   - P1: Registration (foundation)
   - P2: Sign-in (repeat usage)
   - P3: Protected resource access (security enforcement)
   - P4: Unauthorized access handling (security boundary)
   - Each story is independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios

5. **Edge Cases**: Six edge cases identified covering token expiration, concurrent sessions, secret rotation, malformed headers, special characters, and password length limits.

6. **Scope Boundaries**: Clear "Out of Scope" section lists 13 items explicitly excluded (OAuth, refresh tokens, RBAC, password reset, etc.)

7. **Dependencies and Assumptions**:
   - 5 dependencies identified (Feature 001, Better Auth, JWT library, environment variables, Neon PostgreSQL, CORS)
   - 10 assumptions documented (library compatibility, token storage, HTTPS, etc.)

8. **Risks**: Three risks identified with mitigation strategies (JWT secret exposure, Better Auth complexity, token expiration UX)

**Conclusion**: Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning phase (`/sp.plan`).

## Notes

- The specification correctly separates business requirements from technical constraints
- Technology choices (Better Auth, JWT) are documented as constraints, not leaked into functional requirements
- All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No clarifications needed - specification is ready for implementation planning
