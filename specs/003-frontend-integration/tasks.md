# Tasks: Frontend Application and Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-frontend-integration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL and not included in this task list as they were not explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a web application with separate frontend and backend:
- Frontend: `frontend/` directory (Next.js 15+ App Router)
- Backend: `backend/` directory (existing FastAPI from Spec 2)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P6)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (independently testable)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Components marked [P] can be created in parallel (different files)
- Integration tasks depend on component creation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all auth components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create SignupForm component in frontend/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx"
Task: "Create SigninForm component in frontend/components/auth/SigninForm.tsx"
Task: "Create FormInput component in frontend/components/ui/FormInput.tsx"
Task: "Create Button component in frontend/components/ui/Button.tsx"
Task: "Create ErrorMessage component in frontend/components/ui/ErrorMessage.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all task display components for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create TaskList component in frontend/components/tasks/TaskList.tsx"
Task: "Create TaskItem component in frontend/components/tasks/TaskItem.tsx"
Task: "Create EmptyState component in frontend/components/ui/EmptyState.tsx"
Task: "Create LoadingSpinner component in frontend/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (View Task List)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test authentication and task viewing independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

**Rationale**: Authentication + viewing tasks is the minimum viable product. Users can sign up, sign in, and see their tasks. This validates the full-stack integration (frontend → backend → database) before adding write operations.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Auth works!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP - can view tasks!)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Can create tasks!)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Can edit tasks!)
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Can complete tasks!)
7. Add User Story 6 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Full CRUD complete!)
8. Add Polish → Final release
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (View Task List)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Create Task)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Continue with remaining stories (US4, US5, US6) in parallel

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 6 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 16 tasks (CRITICAL PATH)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Authentication)**: 10 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US2 - View Task List)**: 8 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Create Task)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Update Task)**: 3 tasks
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Complete Task)**: 4 tasks
- **Phase 8 (US6 - Delete Task)**: 4 tasks
- **Phase 9 (Polish)**: 10 tasks

**Total**: 66 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 42 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 (40 tasks) deliver authentication + task viewing

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All paths use frontend/ directory for Next.js application
- Backend API from Spec 2 must be running for integration testing
- Environment variables must be configured before running frontend
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
