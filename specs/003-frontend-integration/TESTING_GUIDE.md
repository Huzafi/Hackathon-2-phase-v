## Prerequisites

### 1. Backend API Running

Ensure the FastAPI backend is running:

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Verify backend is accessible at: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 2. Frontend Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # If not already installed
npm run dev
```

Frontend should be accessible at: http://localhost:3000

### 3. Environment Configuration

Verify `frontend/.env.local` contains:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Phase 3: End-to-End User Flows (T080)

**Objective**: Test complete user journey from signup to task management

#### Test 3.1: User Signup Flow

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign Up" or navigate to `/signup`
3. Enter email: `testuser1@example.com`
4. Enter password: `password123` (min 8 chars)
5. Click "Sign Up"

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Form validates email format
- ✅ Form validates password length (min 8 chars)

- ✅ Loading skeleton shows while fetching
- ✅ Empty state shows if no tasks exist
- ✅ Each task shows: title, description, completion status, creation date
- ✅ Tasks are sorted (newest first)

#### Test 3.5: Update Task Flow

1. Sign in and navigate to `/tasks`
2. Click "Edit" button on a task

### Phase 4: JWT Token Verification (T081)

**Objective**: Verify JWT token is included in all protected API requests

#### Test 4.1: Inspect Network Requests

1. Sign in as `testuser1@example.com`
2. Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab
3. Perform actions: create task, update task, delete task
4. Inspect each API request

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All requests to `/api/tasks` include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- ✅ Token format is valid JWT (3 parts separated by dots)
- ✅ Token is automatically injected by API client

#### Test 4.2: Verify Token Storage

1. Sign in successfully
2. Open Chrome DevTools → Application tab → Local Storage
3. Inspect `localStorage` for `http://localhost:3000`

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ `token` key exists in localStorage
- ✅ Token value is a valid JWT string
- ✅ Token persists across page refreshes

#### Test 4.3: Test 401 Unauthorized Handling

1. Sign in successfully
2. Open Chrome DevTools → Application tab → Local Storage
3. Manually delete the `token` key
4. Try to perform any action (create task, etc.)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ API returns 401 Unauthorized
- ✅ User is automatically redirected to `/signin`
- ✅ Token is cleared from localStorage

### Phase 5: User Isolation Testing (T082)

**Objective**: Verify users can only see and manage their own tasks

#### Test 5.1: Create Two User Accounts

**User 1**:
1. Sign up with email: `alice@example.com`, password: `password123`
2. Create 3 tasks:
   - "Alice Task 1"
   - "Alice Task 2"
   - "Alice Task 3"
3. Sign out

**User 2**:
1. Sign up with email: `bob@example.com`, password: `password123`
2. Create 2 tasks:
   - "Bob Task 1"
   - "Bob Task 2"
3. Sign out

#### Test 5.2: Verify Task Isolation

1. Sign in as `alice@example.com`
2. Navigate to `/tasks`
3. Verify only Alice's 3 tasks are visible
4. Sign out

5. Sign in as `bob@example.com`
6. Navigate to `/tasks`
7. Verify only Bob's 2 tasks are visible
8. Sign out

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Alice sees only her 3 tasks (not Bob's tasks)
- ✅ Bob sees only his 2 tasks (not Alice's tasks)
- ✅ Each user can only edit/delete their own tasks
- ✅ API enforces user isolation via JWT token

#### Test 5.3: Verify API Filtering

1. Sign in as `alice@example.com`
2. Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab
3. Inspect GET `/api/tasks` response
4. Verify response contains only Alice's tasks

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ API response contains only tasks belonging to authenticated user
- ✅ User ID is extracted from JWT token
- ✅ Database queries filter by user ID

### Phase 6: Accessibility Testing

**Objective**: Verify ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

#### Test 6.1: Keyboard Navigation

1. Navigate to `/signin` using only keyboard (Tab key)
2. Fill form and submit using Enter key
3. Navigate to `/tasks`
4. Use Tab to navigate through task list
5. Use Enter to toggle checkboxes
6. Use Tab to reach Edit/Delete buttons

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- ✅ Focus indicators are visible
- ✅ Tab order is logical
- ✅ Enter key submits forms
- ✅ Escape key cancels edit mode

#### Test 6.2: Screen Reader Testing

1. Enable screen reader (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac)
2. Navigate through the application
3. Verify all elements are announced correctly

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Form labels are announced
- ✅ Error messages are announced (role="alert")
- ✅ Loading states are announced (aria-live="polite")
- ✅ Task actions have descriptive aria-labels
- ✅ Semantic HTML is used (article, section, time)

### Phase 7: Error Handling Testing

**Objective**: Verify graceful error handling

#### Test 7.1: Backend Offline

1. Stop the FastAPI backend server
2. Try to sign in
3. Try to create a task (if already signed in)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Error message shows: "Failed to connect to server"
- ✅ Error toast notification appears
- ✅ Loading state stops
- ✅ User can retry action

#### Test 7.2: Network Timeout

1. Throttle network to "Slow 3G" in DevTools
2. Perform actions (create task, update task)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Loading states show during slow requests
- ✅ Actions complete successfully (just slower)
- ✅ No timeout errors (reasonable timeout limits)

#### Test 7.3: Invalid API Responses

1. Modify backend to return invalid JSON
2. Try to fetch tasks

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Error is caught and handled gracefully
- ✅ User sees friendly error message
- ✅ Application doesn't crash
