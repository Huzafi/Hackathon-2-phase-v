# Implementation Plan: Frontend Application and Integration

**Branch**: `003-frontend-integration` | **Date**: 2026-01-21 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-frontend-integration/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a responsive Next.js frontend application that integrates with the secured FastAPI backend. Implement authentication flows (signup/signin) using Better Auth with JWT tokens, and provide full CRUD task management functionality. The frontend must enforce user isolation by including JWT tokens in all API requests, handle loading/error/empty states gracefully, and provide a modern, responsive UI that works across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.7+ with Next.js 15.1+ (App Router)
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Next.js 15.1+ (React 19.0+) - Frontend framework with App Router
- Better Auth 1.0.7+ - Authentication with JWT token management
- React 19.0+ - UI library
- TypeScript 5.7+ - Type safety

**Storage**: Browser localStorage/sessionStorage for JWT token persistence
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Jest + React Testing Library recommended for Next.js)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with ES6+ support
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend only, integrates with existing FastAPI backend)
**Performance Goals**:
- Page load < 2 seconds on standard connection
- API operations complete < 2 seconds with visual feedback
- Responsive UI at 60fps during interactions

**Constraints**:
- Must integrate with existing FastAPI backend from Spec 2
- JWT tokens must be included in all protected API requests
- Responsive design: 320px (mobile) to 1920px (desktop)
- No offline support (out of scope)
- No real-time updates (out of scope)

**Scale/Scope**:
- 6 core user stories (auth, view, create, update, complete, delete tasks)
- ~5-8 pages/routes (signin, signup, task list, task detail/edit)
- ~10-15 React components
- Multi-user support with user isolation enforced by backend

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with separate frontend and backend directories. Frontend uses Next.js 15+ App Router with route groups for authentication and protected pages. The `(auth)` route group contains public authentication pages (signin, signup), while the `(protected)` route group contains pages that require JWT authentication. API client layer in `lib/api/` handles automatic JWT header injection for all backend requests.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Next.js App Router with Route Groups

**Decision**: Use App Router with `(auth)` and `(protected)` route groups

**Rationale**:
- Server-side authentication checks prevent FOUC
- Clear separation of public and protected routes
- Aligns with Next.js 15+ best practices
- Enables middleware-based auth without repetitive checks

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- Pages Router: Legacy, not recommended for new projects
- Client-side only auth: Security risk, poor UX (FOUC)

**ADR Candidate**: Yes - significant architectural decision affecting routing and security

---

### 2. Centralized API Client with JWT Injection

**Decision**: Create `lib/api/client.ts` with automatic JWT header injection

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth for API configuration
- Eliminates repetitive JWT injection code
- Centralized error handling (401 → redirect to signin)
- Type-safe API calls with TypeScript

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- Manual fetch in components: Repetitive, error-prone
- SWR/React Query without wrapper: Still requires manual JWT injection

**ADR Candidate**: Yes - significant decision affecting all API interactions

---

### 3. Middleware-Based Authentication

**Decision**: Use Next.js middleware to check JWT before rendering protected pages

**Rationale**:
- Server-side auth checks prevent unauthorized access
- Redirects happen before page render (no FOUC)
- Single auth check for all protected routes
- Better security than client-side checks

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- Client-side auth checks: Can be bypassed, causes FOUC
- Per-page auth checks: Repetitive, easy to forget

**ADR Candidate**: Yes - critical security decision

---

### 4. Tailwind CSS for Responsive Design

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS with mobile-first responsive utilities

**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach speeds development
- Built-in responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- No custom CSS needed for most use cases
- Excellent Next.js integration

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- CSS Modules: More verbose, requires custom media queries
- Styled Components: Runtime overhead, not ideal for App Router

**ADR Candidate**: No - standard technology choice, not architecturally significant

---

### 5. React Suspense + Error Boundaries for State Handling

**Decision**: Use Next.js built-in `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` files with React Suspense

**Rationale**:
- Declarative loading and error states
- Consistent UX across all pages
- Built-in Next.js support
- Reduces boilerplate in components

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- Manual loading flags: Repetitive, inconsistent
- Global loading spinner: Poor UX, doesn't show what's loading

**ADR Candidate**: No - standard React pattern, not architecturally significant

---

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

Based on the three-part test (Impact + Alternatives + Scope), the following decisions should be documented as ADRs:

1. **ADR-001: Next.js App Router with Route Groups for Authentication**
   - Impact: Long-term routing and security architecture
   - Alternatives: Pages Router, client-side auth, per-page checks
   - Scope: Cross-cutting, affects all pages and security

2. **ADR-002: Centralized API Client with Automatic JWT Injection**
   - Impact: All backend communication patterns
   - Alternatives: Manual fetch, SWR/React Query without wrapper
   - Scope: Cross-cutting, affects all API interactions

3. **ADR-003: Middleware-Based Authentication for Protected Routes**
   - Impact: Security model and user experience
   - Alternatives: Client-side checks, per-page checks
   - Scope: Cross-cutting, affects security and routing

**Suggestion**: After `/sp.tasks` is complete, run `/sp.adr` to document these decisions.
