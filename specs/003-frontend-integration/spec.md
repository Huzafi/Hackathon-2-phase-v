## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Authentication (Priority: P1)

A new user visits the application and needs to create an account to access their personal task list. An existing user needs to sign in to access their previously created tasks. The authentication system must securely issue JWT tokens that enable access to protected API endpoints.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundation of the multi-user system. Without it, no other features can function properly. This is the critical path that blocks all subsequent user interactions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new account, signing out, and signing back in. Delivers the ability to establish user identity and secure access to the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the application, **When** they fill out the signup form with valid email and password, **Then** an account is created, a JWT token is issued, and they are redirected to the task list page
2. **Given** an existing user on the signin page, **When** they enter correct credentials, **Then** they receive a JWT token and are redirected to their task list
3. **Given** a user on the signin page, **When** they enter incorrect credentials, **Then** they see an error message and remain on the signin page
4. **Given** a user with an expired or invalid token, **When** they attempt to access protected pages, **Then** they are redirected to the signin page
5. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they click the sign out button, **Then** their token is cleared and they are redirected to the signin page

---

### User Story 2 - View Task List (Priority: P2)

An authenticated user needs to see all their personal tasks in a clear, organized list. The list should display task details including title, description, completion status, and creation date. The interface must handle loading states while fetching data, empty states when no tasks exist, and error states when the API is unavailable.

**Why this priority**: Viewing tasks is the primary use case of the application. Users must be able to see their tasks before they can interact with them. This is the core read operation that validates the full-stack integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by signing in and viewing the task list page. Delivers immediate value by showing users their existing tasks and confirming the frontend-backend integration works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user with existing tasks, **When** they navigate to the task list page, **Then** they see all their tasks displayed with title, description, completion status, and creation date
2. **Given** an authenticated user with no tasks, **When** they navigate to the task list page, **Then** they see an empty state message encouraging them to create their first task
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** the task list is loading from the API, **Then** they see a loading indicator
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** the API request fails, **Then** they see an error message with an option to retry
5. **Given** an authenticated user viewing their task list, **When** another user's tasks exist in the database, **Then** they only see their own tasks (enforced by backend JWT validation)

---

### User Story 3 - Create New Task (Priority: P3)

An authenticated user needs to add new tasks to their personal list. They should be able to enter a task title and optional description, then submit the form to create the task. The new task should immediately appear in their task list after successful creation.

**Why this priority**: Creating tasks is the primary write operation and the first step in the task management workflow. Without this, users cannot populate their task list with meaningful data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by signing in, clicking "Add Task", filling out the form, and submitting. Delivers the ability to capture and persist user tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user on the task list page, **When** they click the "Add Task" button, **Then** a task creation form appears
2. **Given** a user viewing the task creation form, **When** they enter a task title and optional description and submit, **Then** the task is created via API, the form closes, and the new task appears in the list
3. **Given** a user viewing the task creation form, **When** they submit without entering a title, **Then** they see a validation error message
4. **Given** a user viewing the task creation form, **When** the API request fails, **Then** they see an error message and the form remains open with their input preserved
5. **Given** a user creating a task, **When** the task is successfully created, **Then** the JWT token is included in the API request and the task is associated with their user ID

---

### User Story 4 - Update Task (Priority: P4)

An authenticated user needs to edit existing tasks to correct mistakes or update information. They should be able to modify the task title and description, then save the changes. The updated task should reflect the changes immediately in the task list.

**Why this priority**: Editing tasks is essential for maintaining accurate task information over time. This is a secondary write operation that enhances usability but is not critical for the MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a task, clicking edit, modifying the content, and saving. Delivers the ability to maintain accurate task information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user viewing their task list, **When** they click the edit button on a task, **Then** an edit form appears pre-filled with the current task data
2. **Given** a user viewing the task edit form, **When** they modify the title or description and submit, **Then** the task is updated via API and the changes appear in the list
3. **Given** a user viewing the task edit form, **When** they clear the title and submit, **Then** they see a validation error message
4. **Given** a user editing a task, **When** the API request fails, **Then** they see an error message and the form remains open with their changes preserved
5. **Given** a user editing a task, **When** they cancel the edit, **Then** the form closes and no changes are saved

---

### User Story 5 - Complete Task (Priority: P5)

An authenticated user needs to mark tasks as complete when they finish them. They should be able to toggle the completion status with a single click. Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from incomplete tasks (e.g., strikethrough text, different color).

**Why this priority**: Marking tasks as complete is the primary way users track their progress. This is a simple but important interaction that provides immediate feedback and satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a task and clicking the completion checkbox. Delivers the ability to track task completion status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user viewing an incomplete task, **When** they click the completion checkbox, **Then** the task is marked as complete via API and visually updated (e.g., strikethrough, checkmark)
2. **Given** an authenticated user viewing a completed task, **When** they click the completion checkbox, **Then** the task is marked as incomplete via API and the visual styling is removed
3. **Given** a user toggling task completion, **When** the API request fails, **Then** they see an error message and the task status reverts to its previous state
4. **Given** a user viewing their task list, **When** tasks have different completion statuses, **Then** completed and incomplete tasks are visually distinguishable

---

### User Story 6 - Delete Task (Priority: P6)

An authenticated user needs to remove tasks they no longer need. They should be able to delete a task with a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletion. The deleted task should immediately disappear from the task list.

**Why this priority**: Deleting tasks is important for maintaining a clean task list, but it's the lowest priority core feature since users can simply ignore unwanted tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a task, clicking delete, confirming the action, and verifying the task is removed. Delivers the ability to remove unwanted tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user viewing their task list, **When** they click the delete button on a task, **Then** a confirmation dialog appears
2. **Given** a user viewing the delete confirmation dialog, **When** they confirm the deletion, **Then** the task is deleted via API and removed from the list
3. **Given** a user viewing the delete confirmation dialog, **When** they cancel the deletion, **Then** the dialog closes and the task remains in the list
4. **Given** a user deleting a task, **When** the API request fails, **Then** they see an error message and the task remains in the list

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's JWT token expires while they are actively using the application?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during API requests?
- What happens when a user tries to access the application with an invalid or tampered JWT token?
- How does the system handle concurrent updates (e.g., user edits a task in two browser tabs)?
- What happens when the backend API returns unexpected error codes or malformed responses?
- How does the system handle very long task titles or descriptions that might break the UI layout?
- What happens when a user rapidly clicks action buttons (e.g., create, update, delete) multiple times?
- How does the system handle browser back/forward navigation during form submissions?
