   - [ ] Verify redirect to `/signin`

**Expected Behavior:**
- All API requests to `/api/tasks/*` include JWT token
- Requests without token return 401 Unauthorized
- Middleware redirects unauthenticated users

### T082: Verify User Isolation

**Objective**: Confirm users can only see and manage their own tasks

**How to Test:**

1. **Create First User Account:**
   - [ ] Sign up with `user1@example.com`
   - [ ] Create 3 tasks:
     - "User 1 Task A"
     - "User 1 Task B"
     - "User 1 Task C"
   - [ ] Note the task IDs from Network tab
   - [ ] Sign out

2. **Create Second User Account:**
   - [ ] Sign up with `user2@example.com`
   - [ ] Verify task list is empty (no User 1 tasks visible)
   - [ ] Create 2 tasks:
     - "User 2 Task X"
     - "User 2 Task Y"
   - [ ] Verify only User 2 tasks visible

3. **Test Cross-User Access:**
   - [ ] Copy a User 1 task ID
   - [ ] While signed in as User 2, try to:
     - Update User 1's task (should fail with 403/404)
     - Delete User 1's task (should fail with 403/404)
     - Complete User 1's task (should fail with 403/404)
   - [ ] Verify User 2 cannot access User 1's tasks

4. **Switch Back to User 1:**
   - [ ] Sign out from User 2
   - [ ] Sign in as User 1
   - [ ] Verify only User 1's 3 tasks visible
   - [ ] Verify User 2's tasks are NOT visible

5. **Test API Directly (Optional):**
   - [ ] Use Postman or curl
   - [ ] Send GET request to `/api/tasks` with User 1 token
   - [ ] Verify only User 1 tasks returned
   - [ ] Send GET request with User 2 token
   - [ ] Verify only User 2 tasks returned

**Expected Behavior:**
- Each user sees only their own tasks
- API returns 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found for unauthorized access
- JWT token determines which user's data is returned
- No data leakage between users
