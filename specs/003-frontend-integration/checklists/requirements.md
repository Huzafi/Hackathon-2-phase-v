# Specification Quality Checklist: Frontend Application and Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses on user needs and business value without implementation details. While Next.js and FastAPI are mentioned in the input context, the actual requirements are technology-agnostic (e.g., "System MUST provide a signup form" rather than "Next.js component must render signup form").

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed with comprehensive content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are specific and actionable.

✅ **PASS** - All 30 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Each requirement uses clear MUST statements with specific capabilities (e.g., FR-001: "System MUST provide a signup form that accepts email and password and creates a new user account via the backend API").

✅ **PASS** - All 10 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
- Time-based: "under 1 minute", "under 5 seconds", "under 2 seconds"
- Range-based: "320px to 1920px"
- Percentage-based: "100% of API requests"
- Qualitative with clear verification: "no raw error codes or technical jargon"

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic and focus on user outcomes rather than implementation details.

✅ **PASS** - All 6 user stories have comprehensive acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format. Total of 23 acceptance scenarios across all stories.

✅ **PASS** - 8 edge cases identified covering token expiration, network issues, concurrent updates, malformed responses, UI layout issues, rapid clicks, and navigation.

✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded with comprehensive "Out of Scope" section listing 17 excluded features.

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies section lists 5 critical dependencies. Assumptions section lists 10 reasonable assumptions about the environment and existing systems.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 30 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in the user stories. Each requirement is independently verifiable.

✅ **PASS** - 6 prioritized user stories (P1-P6) cover all primary flows:
- P1: Authentication (foundation)
- P2: View tasks (core read)
- P3: Create tasks (core write)
- P4: Update tasks (secondary write)
- P5: Complete tasks (status toggle)
- P6: Delete tasks (cleanup)

✅ **PASS** - All success criteria are measurable and achievable. The feature delivers clear value: secure multi-user task management with full CRUD operations.

✅ **PASS** - No implementation details leak into the specification. Requirements describe WHAT the system must do, not HOW it should be implemented.

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: EXCELLENT

The specification is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for planning. Key strengths:

1. **Clear Prioritization**: User stories are prioritized P1-P6 with clear rationale for each priority level
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 30 functional requirements, 23 acceptance scenarios, 8 edge cases
3. **Measurable Success**: All 10 success criteria have specific, verifiable metrics
4. **Well-Bounded Scope**: Clear dependencies, assumptions, and out-of-scope items
5. **Technology-Agnostic**: Focuses on user needs and business value, not implementation details

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ YES

The specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` (if needed) or `/sp.plan` to proceed with architectural planning.

**No Issues Found**: All checklist items pass validation. No spec updates required.
