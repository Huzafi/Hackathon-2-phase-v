# Feature Specification: Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Phase II)

**Feature Branch**: `001-todo-web-app`
**Created**: 2026-01-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Phase II) - Transform console-based todo app into secure, multi-user web application with Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and JWT authentication"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Registration and Authentication (Priority: P1)

A new user visits the application and needs to create an account to start managing their todos. They provide their email and password, create an account, and then sign in to access the application. Existing users can sign in directly with their credentials.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is foundational - users must have accounts before they can create or manage any todos. Without this, no other features can function in a multi-user environment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering a new account, signing out, signing back in, and verifying that the user session is maintained. Delivers the ability for multiple users to have separate accounts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the application, **When** they provide a valid email and password and submit the registration form, **Then** their account is created and they are signed in automatically
2. **Given** a user has an existing account, **When** they provide correct credentials on the signin page, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the todos page
3. **Given** a user provides incorrect credentials, **When** they attempt to sign in, **Then** they see an error message and remain on the signin page
4. **Given** a user is signed in, **When** they close the browser and return later, **Then** their session is maintained and they remain signed in
5. **Given** a user attempts to access the todos page without being signed in, **When** the page loads, **Then** they are redirected to the signin page

---

### User Story 2 - Create and View Todos (Priority: P2)

An authenticated user can create new todo items by providing a title and optional description. After creating todos, they can view a list of all their todos. Each user sees only their own todos, never those of other users.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - users need to add tasks and see their task list. This represents the minimum viable product for a todo application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by signing in, creating multiple todos with different titles and descriptions, and verifying that all created todos appear in the list. Delivers the fundamental task management capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user is on the todos page, **When** they enter a todo title and click create, **Then** the new todo appears in their list immediately
2. **Given** an authenticated user creates a todo with both title and description, **When** they view their todo list, **Then** both the title and description are displayed
3. **Given** an authenticated user has created several todos, **When** they view their todo list, **Then** all their todos are displayed in reverse chronological order (newest first)
4. **Given** two different users each create todos, **When** each user views their todo list, **Then** they see only their own todos, not the other user's todos
5. **Given** an authenticated user has no todos, **When** they view the todos page, **Then** they see an empty state message prompting them to create their first todo

### User Story 3 - Mark Todos Complete/Incomplete (Priority: P3)

An authenticated user can mark any of their todos as complete or incomplete by toggling the completion status. Completed todos are visually distinguished from incomplete todos, allowing users to track their progress.

**Why this priority**: Tracking completion status is essential for task management - users need to know what's done and what's pending. This adds significant value beyond just listing tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating several todos, marking some as complete, verifying the visual distinction, and toggling completion status back and forth. Delivers progress tracking capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user has an incomplete todo, **When** they click the completion toggle, **Then** the todo is marked as complete and visually distinguished (e.g., strikethrough text)
2. **Given** an authenticated user has a complete todo, **When** they click the completion toggle, **Then** the todo is marked as incomplete and returns to normal appearance
3. **Given** an authenticated user has a mix of complete and incomplete todos, **When** they view their todo list, **Then** they can easily distinguish between completed and incomplete items
4. **Given** an authenticated user marks a todo as complete, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the todo remains marked as complete

---

### User Story 4 - Edit Todos (Priority: P4)

An authenticated user can edit any of their existing todos to update the title or description. This allows users to correct mistakes or update task details as requirements change.

**Why this priority**: Users need the ability to modify tasks after creation to fix typos or update information. This is important for usability but not critical for the initial MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a todo, editing its title and description, and verifying the changes are saved and displayed. Delivers task modification capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user has an existing todo, **When** they click edit and modify the title, **Then** the updated title is saved and displayed in the todo list
2. **Given** an authenticated user is editing a todo, **When** they modify the description, **Then** the updated description is saved and displayed
3. **Given** an authenticated user is editing a todo, **When** they cancel the edit without saving, **Then** the original todo content remains unchanged
4. **Given** an authenticated user edits a todo, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the edited content persists

---

### User Story 5 - Delete Todos (Priority: P5)

An authenticated user can permanently delete any of their todos. Once deleted, the todo is removed from their list and cannot be recovered.

**Why this priority**: Users need to remove completed or unwanted tasks to keep their list manageable. This is important for long-term usability but not essential for initial functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating several todos, deleting some, and verifying they no longer appear in the list. Delivers task cleanup capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user has an existing todo, **When** they click delete and confirm, **Then** the todo is permanently removed from their list
2. **Given** an authenticated user deletes a todo, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the deleted todo does not reappear
3. **Given** an authenticated user has multiple todos, **When** they delete one, **Then** only that specific todo is removed and others remain unchanged
4. **Given** an authenticated user attempts to delete a todo, **When** they are prompted for confirmation, **Then** they can cancel the deletion and the todo remains in their list

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to create a todo with an empty title? System prevents creation and displays validation error.
- What happens when a user's session expires while they're viewing todos? System redirects to signin page and preserves the intended destination.
- What happens when a user tries to access another user's todo by manipulating the URL? System returns unauthorized error and does not expose the data.
- What happens when the database connection is lost? System displays user-friendly error message and allows retry.
- What happens when a user submits a todo with an extremely long title or description? System enforces reasonable length limits (title: 200 characters, description: 1000 characters) and displays validation error.
- What happens when multiple users create todos simultaneously? System handles concurrent requests correctly and maintains data isolation.
- What happens when a user tries to edit or delete a todo that no longer exists? System displays appropriate error message.
