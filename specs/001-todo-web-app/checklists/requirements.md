# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Phase II)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification is written in business language without implementation details. All sections focus on user value and business outcomes. Technology stack is mentioned only in Constraints section where appropriate.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. All 5 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios. Edge cases comprehensively identified. Scope clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section. Dependencies and assumptions documented.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Each of the 5 user stories has detailed acceptance scenarios that map to functional requirements. User scenarios are prioritized (P1-P5) and independently testable. Success criteria are measurable and verifiable without implementation knowledge.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/sp.plan`)
- All user stories are independently testable and prioritized by value
- Security requirements are comprehensive and align with multi-user architecture
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults for unspecified details
- No clarifications needed - all ambiguities resolved with informed decisions

## Recommendation

✅ **APPROVED** - Specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for architectural planning.

Next step: Run `/sp.plan` to generate implementation plan.
