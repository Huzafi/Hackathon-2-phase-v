## Prompt

```text
/sp.plan

Create:
- High-level backend architecture (FastAPI + SQLModel + Neon)
- Database schema for User and Task
- REST API contract for task operations

Decisions needing documentation:
- Task schema fields and relationships
- User-task ownership enforcement via user_id
- Error-handling strategy and HTTP status usage

Testing & validation:
- Verify CRUD operations against database
- Confirm user-scoped queries return correct data
- Validate persistence across restarts
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed comprehensive backend architecture planning for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application. The planning process followed the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow and produced the following deliverables:

**Phase 0 - Research (research.md)**:
- Documented FastAPI + SQLModel integration patterns
- Defined Neon Serverless PostgreSQL connection management strategy
- Established Better Auth JWT verification pattern with dependency injection
- Specified bcrypt password hashing approach
- Created HTTP status code taxonomy for error handling
- Defined user-scoped query patterns for data isolation
- Outlined testing strategy with pytest and TestClient
- Identified 3 architectural decisions requiring ADRs

**Phase 1 - Design**:
- **Data Model (data-model.md)**: Defined User and Todo entities with one-to-many relationship, including field constraints, indexes, validation rules, and security considerations
- **API Contracts (contracts/)**: Created comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for authentication endpoints (signup, signin, me) and todo CRUD endpoints (list, create, get, update, patch, delete)
- **Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md)**: Produced step-by-step setup instructions covering prerequisites, environment configuration, database initialization, and troubleshooting

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- ✅ All 6 constitutional principles verified and satisfied
- ✅ Security-first design enforced (JWT auth, user_id filtering, environment variables)
- ✅ Multi-user data isolation strategy documented
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns maintained
- ✅ Zero manual coding approach specified (specialized agents)

**Technology Stack Finalized**:
- Backend: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- ORM: SQLModel (combines SQLAlchemy + Pydantic)
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Better Auth with JWT tokens
- Testing: pytest with TestClient and in-memory SQLite

**Agent Context Updated**: CLAUDE.md updated with technology stack for future implementation tasks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive backend architecture plan created with all design artifacts (research, data model, API contracts, quickstart). Ready for task breakdown phase (/sp.tasks).
- 🧪 Tests: No tests executed during planning phase (design-only). Testing strategy documented in research.md for implementation phase.
- 📁 Files: Created 6 new files (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, 2 OpenAPI contracts) + updated CLAUDE.md with technology stack.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.tasks` to break down implementation into actionable tasks, then use specialized agents (fastapi-backend-dev, neon-db-specialist, auth-specialist) for implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase successfully completed all constitutional checks. Three architectural decisions identified for ADR documentation (database schema, JWT authentication, error handling taxonomy). User consent required before creating ADRs.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All constitutional gates passed. No blockers encountered.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitutional Check: PASS (all 6 principles satisfied). No automated graders run during planning phase.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan workflow with user-specified focus on backend architecture, database schema, and API contracts.
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.tasks to generate actionable implementation tasks. Consider suggesting ADR creation for the 3 identified architectural decisions.
