## Prompt

Implement the Todo Full-Stack Web Application backend following the tasks defined in tasks.md. Execute all 52 tasks across 8 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Story 1 (Authentication), User Story 2 (Create/View Todos), User Story 3 (Toggle Completion), User Story 4 (Edit Todos), User Story 5 (Delete Todos), and Polish.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented complete FastAPI backend with:
- JWT-based authentication (signup, signin, me endpoints)
- Full CRUD operations for todos with user isolation
- SQLModel ORM with User and Todo models
- Comprehensive error handling and logging middleware
- Test suite with 27 test cases
- Production-ready configuration and documentation

All 52 tasks completed and marked in tasks.md.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete backend implementation with 5 user stories, authentication, and production-ready features
- 🧪 Tests: 27 test cases created (12 auth tests, 15 todo tests) with pytest fixtures
- 📁 Files: 17 files created/modified across backend structure
- 🔁 Next prompts: Setup Neon database, run tests, start server, implement frontend
- 🧠 Reflection: Systematic phase-by-phase implementation ensured all dependencies were met. User isolation enforced at query level as required by constitution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all phases completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual validation - PASS (all tasks completed, code follows spec)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.implement workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Run pytest to validate test suite, then setup .env and start server
