## Prompt

```text
/sp.specify Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Phase II)

Target audience:
- Evaluators reviewing spec-driven, agentic full-stack development
- Developers learning Agentic Dev Stack workflows
- Hackathon judges assessing architecture, security, and execution quality

Focus:
- Transforming a console-based todo app into a secure, multi-user web application
- End-to-end integration of frontend, backend, database, and authentication
- Demonstrating JWT-based auth between Next.js and FastAPI
- Strict adherence to spec → plan → tasks → implementation workflow

Success criteria:
- All 5 basic todo features implemented as a web app
- REST API fully functional and documented
- JWT authentication enforced on every API request
- Each user can only access their own tasks
- Frontend successfully integrates with secured backend
- Neon PostgreSQL persists data correctly across sessions
- No manual coding outside Claude Code outputs

Constraints:
- Tech stack is fixed:
  - Frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router)
  - Backend: FastAPI (Python)
  - ORM: SQLModel
  - Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
  - Authentication: Better Auth (JWT-based)
- All secrets handled via environment variables
- API must be stateless
- Multi-user support is mandatory
- Development must follow Agentic Dev Stack process
- Timeline: Hackathon Phase-2 duration

Not building:
- Role-based access control (admin/moderator roles)
- Advanced task features (tags, priorities, reminders)
- Real-time updates (WebSockets, polling)
- Mobile-native applications
- Deployment automation or CI/CD pipelines
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Phase II) with:

**5 Prioritized User Stories:**
1. P1: User Registration and Authentication (foundational)
2. P2: Create and View Todos (core MVP)
3. P3: Mark Todos Complete/Incomplete (progress tracking)
4. P4: Edit Todos (task modification)
5. P5: Delete Todos (task cleanup)

**20 Functional Requirements** covering authentication, authorization, data isolation, validation, error handling, and security.

**10 Success Criteria** with measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes (registration time, todo creation speed, data isolation, session persistence, concurrent user support).

**Key Entities:** User and Todo with clear relationships and attributes.

**Comprehensive Sections:** Edge cases, assumptions, out-of-scope features, dependencies, constraints, and security requirements.

**Quality Validation:** Created requirements checklist - all items passed validation. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed as all ambiguities resolved with informed decisions based on industry standards.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete, validated specification ready for architectural planning
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (specification phase - acceptance scenarios defined for implementation)
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md (222 lines) and requirements.md checklist (both validated)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.plan` to generate implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances completeness with clarity. All user stories are independently testable and prioritized by value. Security requirements comprehensively address multi-user data isolation. No clarifications needed - made informed decisions for all ambiguities.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Requirements checklist - PASS (all 14 validation items passed)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate constitution compliance during planning phase
