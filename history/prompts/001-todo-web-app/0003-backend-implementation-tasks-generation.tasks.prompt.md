## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Todo Backend application, organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. The task breakdown follows the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow and maps directly to the 5 user stories defined in spec.md.

**Task Organization**:
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 6 tasks for project initialization and structure
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 6 tasks for core infrastructure (BLOCKING - must complete before any user story)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Authentication)**: 9 tasks for user registration and signin with JWT
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Create/View Todos)**: 9 tasks for todo creation and listing with user isolation
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Toggle Completion)**: 5 tasks for marking todos complete/incomplete
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Edit Todos)**: 4 tasks for updating todo title and description
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Delete Todos)**: 3 tasks for permanent todo deletion
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 10 tasks for error handling, logging, documentation, and security hardening

**Total**: 52 tasks with 15 parallelizable tasks marked [P]

**Key Features**:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Each user story is independently implementable and testable
- Clear dependency graph showing execution order
- Parallel execution opportunities identified within each phase
- MVP scope defined (30 tasks: Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2)
- Incremental delivery strategy (add one story at a time)
- User isolation enforced in every task involving data access
- Security-first approach (JWT auth, password hashing, ownership verification)

**Design Decisions Mapped to Tasks**:
- User and Todo models from data-model.md → T013, T022
- Authentication endpoints from contracts/auth.openapi.yaml → T016, T017, T018
- Todo CRUD endpoints from contracts/todos.openapi.yaml → T025, T026, T032, T033, T037, T040
- JWT verification pattern from research.md → T010, T012
- Password hashing from research.md → T009
- Database connection management from research.md → T008
- User-scoped query pattern from research.md → enforced in T026, T030, T032, T034

**Tests**: Not included as they were not explicitly requested in spec.md. Test tasks can be added if TDD approach is desired.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive task breakdown created with 52 actionable tasks organized by user story. Ready for implementation using specialized agents (fastapi-backend-dev, neon-db-specialist, auth-specialist).
- 🧪 Tests: No test tasks included (not requested in spec.md). Testing strategy documented in research.md for future reference.
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with complete task breakdown, dependencies, parallel opportunities, and implementation strategies.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.implement` to execute tasks using specialized agents, or manually implement tasks in order (Setup → Foundational → User Stories by priority).
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation successfully mapped all 5 user stories to concrete implementation tasks. Each story is independently testable. MVP scope clearly defined (US1 + US2). Parallel opportunities identified (15 tasks). User isolation and security requirements embedded in every relevant task.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All user stories from spec.md successfully mapped to tasks. All entities from data-model.md mapped to model creation tasks. All endpoints from contracts/ mapped to implementation tasks.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation: PASS (all tasks follow checklist format with ID, optional [P], optional [Story], description with file path). Completeness check: PASS (all 5 user stories have corresponding task phases).
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with user story organization. No tests included per spec.md requirements.
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.implement to execute tasks. Consider adding test tasks if TDD approach is desired. Consider creating ADRs for the 3 architectural decisions identified in research.md.
