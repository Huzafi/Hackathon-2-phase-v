## Prompt

```text
/sp.constitution

Project: Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Phase II)

Core principles:
- Spec-driven development (all implementation must follow written specs)
- Security-first design (authentication, authorization, and data isolation)
- Deterministic and reproducible outputs via Agentic Dev Stack
- Clear separation of concerns (frontend, backend, auth, database)
- Zero manual coding (all code generated through Claude Code)

Key standards:
- All features must map directly to documented requirements
- Every API endpoint must enforce authenticated user context
- JWT-based authentication must be validated on every request
- Database queries must always be scoped to the authenticated user
- Frontend must consume only documented REST APIs
- Errors must be explicit, structured, and consistent (HTTP status codes)

Constraints:
- Tech stack is fixed:
  - Frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router)
  - Backend: FastAPI (Python)
  - ORM: SQLModel
  - Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
  - Authentication: Better Auth with JWT
- No manual code edits outside Claude Code output
- Environment variables must handle all secrets (no hardcoding)
- API must be stateless and JWT-secured
- Multi-user support is mandatory

Success criteria:
- All 5 basic todo features work end-to-end in the web app
- Users can only access and modify their own tasks
- Unauthorized requests return 401 consistently
- Frontend, backend, and auth integrate without bypasses
- Application is production-ready at basic level
- Project follows the Agentic Dev Stack workflow without deviation
```

## Response snapshot

Created initial project constitution (v1.0.0) with six core principles:

1. **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**: All implementation must follow written specifications (spec.md → plan.md → tasks.md)
2. **Security-First Design**: JWT authentication required, user data isolation enforced, secrets in environment variables
3. **Zero Manual Coding**: All code generated through Claude Code specialized agents (nextjs-frontend-builder, fastapi-backend-dev, neon-db-specialist, auth-specialist)
4. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Strict boundaries between frontend (Next.js), backend (FastAPI), database (Neon PostgreSQL), and authentication (Better Auth)
5. **Multi-User Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own data, all queries filtered by authenticated user ID
6. **Environment-Based Configuration**: All secrets and environment-specific values externalized to .env files

Constitution includes:
- Fixed technology stack (Next.js 16+, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, Better Auth)
- SDD workflow (specify → plan → tasks → implement → review)
- Governance rules (amendment process, compliance requirements, complexity justification)
- Sync impact report documenting template alignment

All template files verified for consistency with constitutional principles.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational governance document defining all project principles, constraints, and workflows
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (governance document)
- 📁 Files: Created/updated .specify/memory/constitution.md (v1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for feature specification (/sp.specify) or planning (/sp.plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear guardrails for multi-user security, SDD workflow enforcement, and agent-based development. All principles are testable and enforceable.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (initial constitution)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate constitution compliance during first feature implementation
