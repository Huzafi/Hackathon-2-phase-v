## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for JWT-based authentication system organized by user story:

**Task Organization**:
- Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks) - Environment configuration and dependencies
- Phase 2: Foundational (6 tasks) - Core infrastructure blocking all user stories
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Registration (6 tasks) - MVP scope
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Sign In (4 tasks)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Protected Resources (7 tasks)
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Unauthorized Access (5 tasks)
- Phase 7: Polish (6 tasks)

**Total**: 40 tasks with 12 marked [P] for parallel execution

**User Story Mapping**:
- US1 (P1): New User Registration - 6 tasks (T013-T018)
- US2 (P2): Returning User Sign In - 4 tasks (T019-T022)
- US3 (P3): Accessing Protected Resources - 7 tasks (T023-T029)
- US4 (P4): Handling Unauthorized Access - 5 tasks (T030-T034)

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Register user → Verify account created and JWT issued
- US2: Sign in → Verify JWT issued and dashboard access
- US3: Make authenticated requests → Verify user isolation enforced
- US4: Make unauthorized requests → Verify 401 errors returned

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (T001-T018) - 18 tasks delivering user registration with JWT tokens

**Key Features**:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`
- Clear phase dependencies (Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish)
- Parallel opportunities identified (12 tasks marked [P])
- Each user story independently testable
- Incremental delivery strategy (MVP → Sign In → Protected Resources → Error Handling → Polish)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created actionable task breakdown ready for implementation. Enables independent development and testing of each user story. Clear MVP scope (18 tasks) for rapid value delivery.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run (task generation phase). Tests NOT included in task list as they were not explicitly requested in feature specification.
- 📁 Files: Created 1 file - tasks.md (40 tasks across 7 phases)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` (execute tasks using specialized agents) or manual task execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation successfully organized by user story priority, enabling independent implementation and testing. MVP scope clearly identified (User Story 1 only). Parallel opportunities maximize team efficiency. All tasks include exact file paths for immediate execution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Task generation completed successfully with proper user story organization.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation - PASS (all 40 tasks follow checklist format with IDs, story labels, and file paths)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with user story-based organization
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - workflow executed correctly
