## Prompt

/sp.specify Todo App – Spec 2: Authentication and API Security

Target audience:
- Hackathon evaluators reviewing security correctness
- Developers learning cross-stack authentication (Next.js + FastAPI)
- Teams assessing JWT-based stateless auth patterns

Focus:
- Secure user authentication using Better Auth
- JWT-based identity verification between frontend and backend
- Enforcing strict user isolation across all API operations
- Demonstrating stateless authentication in a multi-service architecture

Success criteria:
- Users can sign up and sign in using Better Auth
- JWT tokens are issued on successful authentication
- All backend API requests require a valid JWT
- FastAPI correctly verifies JWT signatures using shared secret
- Authenticated user identity is extracted from JWT
- Users can only access and modify their own tasks
- Unauthorized or invalid requests return 401 consistently

Constraints:
- Authentication library is fixed: Better Auth
- JWT is the only supported authentication mechanism
- Shared secret must be managed via environment variables
- Backend must remain stateless (no sessions)
- Every protected endpoint must enforce authentication
- Spec-driven development only (no manual coding)
- Timeline: Hackathon Phase-2

Not building:
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Refresh token rotation strategies
- Role-based or permission-based access control
- Account recovery or password reset flows
- Rate limiting or advanced security hardening

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for authentication and API security feature:

**Branch**: 002-auth-api-security

**Specification Highlights**:
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) covering registration, sign-in, protected resource access, and unauthorized access handling
- 20 functional requirements defining authentication flows, JWT token management, and user isolation
- 10 measurable success criteria (all technology-agnostic)
- 6 edge cases identified
- Clear scope boundaries with 13 out-of-scope items
- 5 dependencies and 10 assumptions documented
- 3 risks with mitigation strategies

**Quality Validation**: All checklist items passed
- No implementation details leaked into requirements
- All requirements testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed
- All mandatory sections completed

**Key Design Decisions**:
- JWT tokens expire after 1 hour (no refresh mechanism for MVP)
- Stateless authentication (no server-side session storage)
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
- Consistent error messages to prevent user enumeration
- User isolation enforced at database query level using JWT user ID

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete, unambiguous specification ready for planning phase. Establishes security foundation for multi-user todo application with clear authentication flows and user isolation requirements.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run (specification phase). Spec includes 16 acceptance scenarios across 4 user stories that will guide implementation testing.
- 📁 Files: Created 2 files - spec.md (206 lines) and requirements.md checklist (validation passed)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.clarify` (optional refinement) or `/sp.plan` (architectural design)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances security rigor with hackathon MVP scope. Technology constraints (Better Auth, JWT) properly documented as constraints rather than leaked into functional requirements. All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic as required.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Spec creation completed successfully on first attempt with all quality checks passing.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist validation - PASS (14/14 items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with detailed user input
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - workflow executed correctly
