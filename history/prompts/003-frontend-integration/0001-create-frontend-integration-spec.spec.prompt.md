## Prompt

/sp.specify Todo App – Spec 3: Frontend Application and Integration

Target audience:
- Hackathon judges evaluating usability and full-stack integration
- Developers learning spec-driven frontend + backend workflows
- Users interacting with a secure, multi-user todo web application

Focus:
- Responsive, modern web UI using Next.js 16+ (App Router)
- Integration with secured FastAPI backend via REST API
- Authentication flows (signup/signin) using Better Auth and JWT
- End-to-end task management: create, read, update, delete, complete

Success criteria:
- Fully functional and responsive frontend UI
- Signup and signin flows work correctly and issue JWT
- JWT attached to all API requests and validated by backend
- Users can only view and manipulate their own tasks
- Task list, creation, update, deletion, and completion work seamlessly
- Frontend handles loading, error, and empty states correctly
- Full integration verified with backend APIs and database

Constraints:
- Frontend tech stack fixed: Next.js 16+ with App Router
- No manual code outside Claude Code outputs
- Must integrate with FastAPI backend and Neon PostgreSQL
- JWT token handling must follow Spec 2 implementation
- Multi-user support is mandatory
- Spec-driven workflow must be strictly followed

Not building:
- Progressive Web App or mobile-native app
- Real-time updates (WebSockets, polling)
- Advanced UI features (drag-and-drop, animations)
- Role-based access or admin dashboard
- Deployment pipelines or CI/CD setup

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for frontend application and integration feature (003-frontend-integration).

**Specification Structure**:
- 6 prioritized user stories (P1-P6) covering authentication, task viewing, creation, updating, completion, and deletion
- 30 functional requirements with clear MUST statements
- 10 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- 8 edge cases identified
- 3 key entities defined (User, Task, Authentication Token)
- Comprehensive assumptions, dependencies, and out-of-scope sections

**Validation Results**:
- All specification quality checklist items passed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers required
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- Specification is ready for planning phase

**Branch**: 003-frontend-integration created and checked out
**Files Created**: spec.md and requirements.md checklist

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created production-ready specification for frontend application with full authentication and task management flows. Specification provides clear foundation for multi-user todo application with secure JWT-based authentication.
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality validation completed - all 14 checklist items passed
- 📁 Files: 2 files created (spec.md, checklists/requirements.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan (to create architectural plan), /sp.clarify (optional, if refinement needed)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances comprehensiveness with clarity. All user stories are independently testable with clear priorities. No clarifications needed due to well-defined constraints and assumptions. Ready for immediate planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Specification creation completed without issues. All validation checks passed on first attempt.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification Quality Checklist - PASS (14/14 items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with comprehensive user input
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.plan to validate specification completeness through architectural planning process
