## Prompt

now you can implement spec-3 you have already frontend folder with nextjs initialized.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Feature 003: Frontend Application and Integration with 37 TypeScript files across 9 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup** - Environment configuration, Prettier, Tailwind CSS
**Phase 2: Foundational** - Types, API client with JWT injection, auth context, middleware
**Phase 3: User Story 1** - Authentication (signup, signin, signout)
**Phase 4: User Story 2** - View task list with loading/error/empty states
**Phase 5: User Story 3** - Create new tasks
**Phase 6: User Story 4** - Update existing tasks
**Phase 7: User Story 5** - Complete/incomplete tasks
**Phase 8: User Story 6** - Delete tasks with confirmation
**Phase 9: Polish** - Responsive design, loading states, error handling, accessibility

All 6 core user stories implemented with full CRUD operations on tasks. JWT authentication enforced on all protected routes. Responsive design (320px to 1920px). Production build successful with no TypeScript errors.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete frontend application with authentication and task management. Users can signup, signin, and manage their personal task list with full CRUD operations. Multi-user support with JWT-based user isolation.
- 🧪 Tests: Manual testing required. Automated tests were optional and not included in scope.
- 📁 Files: 37 TypeScript files created (9 pages/layouts, 16 components, 6 library files, 6 type definitions, 1 middleware)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Start backend server, test full-stack integration, add success notifications (T060), optimize performance (T063)
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed spec-driven development principles. All tasks completed sequentially through phases. Specialized nextjs-frontend-builder agent handled all implementation work efficiently.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Implementation completed successfully without errors.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (manual testing required)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add success toast notifications for task operations (T060)
