## Prompt

Now Create tasks for 003-frontend-integration

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for frontend integration feature with 66 tasks organized by user story priority (P1-P6). Tasks follow strict checklist format with task IDs, parallel markers, story labels, and exact file paths.

**Task Organization:**
- Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks) - Project initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational (16 tasks) - Core infrastructure blocking all user stories
- Phase 3-8: User Stories 1-6 (34 tasks) - Independent, testable increments
- Phase 9: Polish (10 tasks) - Cross-cutting improvements

**Key Features:**
- 42 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- Each user story independently testable
- MVP scope: Phases 1-4 (40 tasks) for auth + task viewing
- Clear dependencies and execution order
- Parallel execution examples provided

**User Stories Covered:**
- US1 (P1): Authentication - 10 tasks
- US2 (P2): View Task List - 8 tasks
- US3 (P3): Create Task - 5 tasks
- US4 (P4): Update Task - 3 tasks
- US5 (P5): Complete Task - 4 tasks
- US6 (P6): Delete Task - 4 tasks

All tasks include exact file paths in frontend/ directory and follow Next.js 15+ App Router conventions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated 66 actionable tasks organized by user story, enabling independent implementation and testing of each feature increment
- 🧪 Tests: No test tasks included (tests not explicitly requested in feature specification)
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (specs/003-frontend-integration/tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (to execute tasks) or /sp.adr (to document architectural decisions)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully organized tasks by user story priority, enabling MVP-first delivery (US1+US2) and parallel team execution. All 66 tasks follow required checklist format with IDs, parallel markers, story labels, and file paths.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
