## Prompt

```text
Create:
- Frontend architecture using Next.js App Router
- Auth-aware routing and protected pages
- API client layer with automatic JWT header injection
- Task management UI components

Decisions needing documentation:
- Page and component structure for task workflows
- Strategy for handling loading, error, and empty states
- Auth redirect behavior for unauthenticated users

Testing & validation:
- Verify full CRUD task flow for authenticated users
- Confirm user isolation across multiple accounts
- Validate responsive behavior on different screen sizes
```

## Response snapshot

Completed comprehensive implementation plan for frontend integration feature (003-frontend-integration). Generated all Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts:

**Phase 0 - Research**:
- Resolved all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from Technical Context
- Researched and documented 5 key decisions:
  1. Testing framework: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
  2. Authentication pattern: Middleware-based with route groups
  3. API client: Centralized client with automatic JWT injection
  4. State handling: React Suspense + Error Boundaries
  5. Responsive design: Tailwind CSS mobile-first

**Phase 1 - Design**:
- Created data-model.md with TypeScript types for User, Task, and all request/response types
- Created contracts/auth-api.md documenting authentication endpoints (signup, signin, me)
- Created contracts/tasks-api.md documenting task CRUD endpoints
- Created quickstart.md with setup instructions, troubleshooting, and development workflow
- Updated CLAUDE.md agent context with new technologies

**Architectural Decisions**:
Identified 3 significant decisions requiring ADRs:
1. Next.js App Router with Route Groups for Authentication
2. Centralized API Client with Automatic JWT Injection
3. Middleware-Based Authentication for Protected Routes

**Constitution Check**: All principles satisfied (SDD, Security-First, Zero Manual Coding, Separation of Concerns, Multi-User Isolation, Environment-Based Config)

**Status**: Ready for task generation via `/sp.tasks`

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete architectural plan for Next.js frontend with JWT authentication, API integration, and responsive UI. All design artifacts generated and ready for implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests executed (planning phase). Testing strategy documented in research.md (Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright).
- 📁 Files: Created 6 planning artifacts (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, 2 API contracts, quickstart.md) + updated CLAUDE.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.tasks` to generate implementation tasks, then `/sp.adr` to document 3 architectural decisions, then `/sp.implement` to execute tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase successfully completed all required artifacts. Research resolved all unknowns. Design phase produced comprehensive contracts and data models. Architecture decisions clearly documented with rationale and alternatives. Ready for task breakdown.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All planning steps completed successfully.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check: PASS (all 6 principles satisfied)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.tasks to validate that planning artifacts are sufficient for task generation
