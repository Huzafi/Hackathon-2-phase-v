## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for frontend integration feature (003-frontend-integration). Organized 82 tasks across 9 phases based on 6 user stories from spec.md.

**Task Organization**:
- Phase 1: Setup (17 tasks) - Project initialization and dependencies
- Phase 2: Foundational (14 tasks) - Shared infrastructure (types, API client, middleware)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Authentication (11 tasks) - Signup, signin, signout with JWT
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - View Task List (8 tasks) - Display tasks with loading/error/empty states
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Create Task (6 tasks) - Task creation form and API integration
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Update Task (5 tasks) - Task editing functionality
- Phase 7: User Story 5 - Complete Task (4 tasks) - Toggle completion status
- Phase 8: User Story 6 - Delete Task (4 tasks) - Task deletion with confirmation
- Phase 9: Polish (13 tasks) - Responsive design, accessibility, end-to-end testing

**Key Features**:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] T### [P] [US#] Description with file path`
- 28 tasks marked as parallelizable [P] for concurrent execution
- Each user story phase includes independent test criteria
- Dependencies graph shows critical path and parallel opportunities
- MVP scope identified: Phases 1-3 (Authentication only)
- Incremental delivery strategy: 5 iterations from MVP to full feature

**Mapping from Design Artifacts**:
- User stories (spec.md) → 6 phases (US1-US6)
- Data model (data-model.md) → Type definition tasks (T018-T026)
- API contracts (contracts/) → API function tasks (T032-T034, T043, T051, T057, T062, T066)
- Research decisions (research.md) → Setup tasks (T001-T004 for Tailwind, T027 for middleware)
- Project structure (plan.md) → Directory creation tasks (T005-T016)

**Validation**:
- All 82 tasks have unique IDs (T001-T082)
- All user story tasks have [US#] labels
- All parallelizable tasks have [P] markers
- All tasks include specific file paths
- Each phase has clear acceptance criteria
- Independent test criteria defined for each user story

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for frontend integration with 82 actionable tasks organized by user story. Each task is specific enough for LLM execution. MVP scope identified (authentication only). Parallel execution opportunities documented (28 tasks).
- 🧪 Tests: No tests executed (task generation phase). Testing strategy noted: tests not included as not explicitly requested in spec. Can be added if needed (Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright per research.md).
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with 82 tasks across 9 phases
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.implement` to execute tasks using nextjs-frontend-builder and auth-specialist agents, then `/sp.adr` to document 3 architectural decisions
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation successfully mapped all user stories to implementation tasks. Each phase represents an independently testable increment. Critical path identified: Setup → Foundational → Authentication → View → Create → Update → Polish. Parallel opportunities maximize efficiency (28 parallelizable tasks). MVP scope (authentication) provides early validation point.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All tasks generated successfully with proper format and organization.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation: PASS (all tasks follow checklist format with IDs, labels, file paths). User story mapping: PASS (all 6 user stories mapped to phases). Dependencies: PASS (critical path and parallel opportunities documented).
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with user story organization
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute Phase 1 (Setup) tasks to validate task specificity and file path accuracy
