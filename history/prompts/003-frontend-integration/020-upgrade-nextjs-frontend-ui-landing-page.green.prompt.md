## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Transformed minimal frontend into beautiful, modern UI with professional landing page
- 🧪 Tests: Build verification passed, TypeScript compilation successful, all routes generated

- 🔁 Next prompts: Test the application, add real images/screenshots, implement analytics
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully applied nextjs-landing-page-builder skill patterns to create a production-ready, conversion-optimized landing page with modern design aesthetics

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial build errors (missing types for js-cookie, incorrect auth method name) - resolved by installing @types/js-cookie and fixing signout method
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Build: PASS, TypeScript: PASS, Routes: PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add real product screenshots to hero section, implement Framer Motion for advanced animations
